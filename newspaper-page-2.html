                The murder of Sabina Nessa, six months after the death of Sarah Everard, has once again thrown the topic of women's safety
                walking the streets of UK towns to the forefront of conversation

                    In the course of less than a month, two high-profile cases of women being murdered have sparked debates on how society can
                    better women's safety – the recent murder of American YouTuber Gabby Petito and of British school teacher Sabina Nessa.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Femicide, the killing of a girl or woman, is a topic that has already been highlighted earlier this year, when Sarah Everard,
                    a 33-year-old marketing executive, was killed in South London, on her walk back home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These victims tragically add to a horrifying statistic that has been recently reported: six women are killed every hour by men
                    around the world, according to UN data. Additionally, a woman is killed by a man every three days in the UK.

                <p>
                    According to Karen Ingala Smith, co-founder of the Femicide Census, men’s violence against women is a leading cause of the
                    premature death for women globally but research in the UK and Europe is limited and unconnected.

                <p>
                    Dr Nilufar Ahmed who works as a Behavioural Psychologist at the University of Bristol helped us identify things men can do
                    to help women feel safer and ways to stop violence towards women.

                     <h3>
                        Being taught consent from a young age
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Men should learn to accept a woman's lack of interest in them. Violence inflicted on women is often entangled with sexual
                        assaults, and therefore should be educated on consent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to the United Nations Women (UN Women), freely given and enthusiastic consent should be mandatory, “every time”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        UN Women added that phrases like “she was asking for it” or “boys will be boys” attempt to blur the lines around sexual
                        consent, placing blame on victims, and “excusing perpetrators from the crimes they have committed”.

                    <p>
                        Dr Nilufar Ahmed explained to the Mirror that changing our social attitudes was something that needed to happen across
                        society and from an early age.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She said: "Understanding consent from an early age. ‘No means no’ is often framed in terms of sexual consent and rape,
                        but it has a much bigger application – if someone is rejecting your attention, friendship, or company in any setting,
                        respect this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Schools can play a role in this by teaching young children about respecting boundaries."
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Being taught gender equality in schools
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The World Health Organisation (WHO) published a pamphlet revealing that gender inequalities increase the risk of violence
                        by men against women and inhibit the ability of those affected to seek protection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Experts have found that exposing children to non-stereotypical characters found in books and movies, as well as dividing
                        housework equally at home, can help children understand the notion that all genders are equal.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Stop victim blaming
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Victim blaming is a way for someone to justify their motivation behind their own crime, while literally blaming their
                        victim for their own action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Too often the behaviour and personalities of the women is scrutinised and judged first before the actions of the man who
                        attacked them. Dr Nilufar Ahmed told The Mirror.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She added: "As though it is inevitable that a lone woman walking in the dark is automatically at risk of being attacked.

                        "This victim blaming exonerates men from responsibility and blame by focusing on the woman.

                    <p>
                        "Allied with this, often when men commit heinous crimes, their crimes are qualified with added information about their
                        lives as ‘good fathers’ or ‘high achieving students’, whilst the women are described only in terms of the way they
                        were dressed and their actions that night."

                        Becoming a better ally to women
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Doing something as simple as listening to women and their experiences goes a long way. Men should be able to acknowledge
                        their privilege, as well as taking women’s concerns as a serious issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, men should not shy away from calling out blatant sexism and misogynistic behaviour when they witness it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being supportive and contributing to the safety of women starts by becoming an ally.

                    <h3>
                        Destigmatise men’s mental health
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        As the WHO found that potential perpetrators may be at an increased risk of committing femicide if they are unemployed,
                        own a firearm, have made previous threats to kill with a weapon, or have committed sexual violence, men’s mental health
                        needs to be addressed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Saying things like “man up” or “boys don’t cry” nourishes a culture of toxic masculinity which both prevents men from
                        expressing their feelings, but also lead to dangerous behaviour such as resulting in violence instead of communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to Dr Nilufar Ahmed, there is not one reason that pushes men to harm and kill women, but it can include
                        psychological reasons such as feeling rejected, feeling incapable of attracting a partner, being angry, feeling emasculated,
                        a need to assert control, feeling entitled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "These do not necessarily have to be about women – a man may experience repeated rejection from jobs, be angry at their
                        landlord, etc," She said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She continued: "Unaddressed, this can boil over and be projected onto a target that men are stronger than – women.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Most men experiencing these will not go on to harm women; but if these feelings are overwhelming go unresolved they can
                        be damaging to the individual and others around them, and could in extreme circumstances lead to aggression and even murder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "If men are struggling with any of these issues accessing mental health support can help to work through them."
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Facilitate women’s access to protection and safety against domestic violence
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The WHO has revealed that there is an increased risk of perpetuating femicide if the aggressor has a history of
                        intimate partner or family violence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A men with a history of domestic violence thereby is more likely to murder his partner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Domestic violence is reportedly "not taken seriously in UK courts", as criminologist Jane Monkton-Smith told The Guardian
                        that her examination of 72 domestic abuse killings shows how sentences for manslaughter convictions were often mitigated
                        by “ridiculous claims, like how much the perpetrator said they loved the victim”.

                    <p>
                        Dr Nilufar Ahmed said: "Immediate things men can do are to be mindful to keep a safe distance from women when out walking
                        or running.

                        "If you see a situation where a woman looks uncomfortable don’t be afraid to intervene either yourself or by making someone
