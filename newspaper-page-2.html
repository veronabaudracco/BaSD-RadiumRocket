                            There are a lot of things your employer doesn’t know right now — like the future of remote work or when the

                            The pandemic pushed many into work-from-home setups, and companies turned to employee data to keep tabs on their workforces.
                            Your company can get access to almost everything you do electronically, and monitoring software makes that data easy to collect
                            and analyze.
                        </p>

                            As some employees see work-from-home time extended because of the delta variant spreading across the world, reliance on employee
                            tracking is staying steady at lockdown-level highs, say executives at monitoring software firms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Elizabeth Harz, chief executive of Connecticut-based employee monitoring software provider InterGuard, said one of her clients
                            came to her convinced that remote work would mean “economic ruin” for his company. That was until the client saw what InterGuard
                            could do for his newly dispersed workforce, Harz said. The software tracks employees’ productivity, down to how long it takes to
                            respond to emails.

                            Your company may or may not be collecting data on your every move, but it certainly has the capability. The best way to know for
                            sure is to ask, says Tom Kelly, CEO of consumer privacy firm IDX.

                            On work-issued computers, employers can gather data from your keyboard, like how often you’re typing, and even your webcam, if
                            it’s in your employment agreement. On corporate Internet connections, your employer probably can see which sites you visit,
                            and it can access the emails you send from company accounts. Those without office jobs get monitored, too. Amazon, for instance,

                            Business is booming for companies that make software analyzing the data employees generate during the workday. These programs
                            present reports to superiors on how often employees are typing, when they log off and on, and what social media sites they look
                            at. When the pandemic began last spring, 30 percent of large employers — defined as companies with several thousand workers
                            — adopted employee-tracking software for the first time, says Brian Kropp, chief of HR research for the research and advisory
                            firm Gartner. Now, 60 percent use it in general, he said. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some states — such as Delaware and Connecticut — require employers to provide written notice to workers if their electronic
                            activity is being monitored. If your company gave notice, it probably came in one of the many forms you signed when you accepted
                            the job, Kropp said. But if you get in trouble for something your employer catches you doing while monitoring you remotely, you
                            probably don’t have recourse. Almost all types of employee surveillance are entirely legal, according to Emory Roane, privacy
                            counsel at the nonprofit organization Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.     
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “In general, you have very, very, very light protections, if any, for employee privacy,” says Roane.

                            You may not be able to avoid tracking, but it’s good to know what’s private and what isn’t. Here are five areas your employer
                            might be watching:

                            <p>

                                every email you send and receive, Google and Microsoft said. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But Microsoft says it “does not agree with using technology to spy on people at work.”

                                Companies that pay for monitoring tools such as Teramind can view the content, subject lines and attachments from both
                                professional and personal inboxes, if the employee uses them on the same computer. Employers can put up guardrails around
                                data collection from personal inboxes by telling the tool not to read inboxes accessed in Web browsers, for example, says
                                Eli Sutton, Teramind’s vice president of global operations.

                                Teramind can even scan for signs of disgruntled employees by flagging profanity in emails, as well as visits to job-search
                                sites or negative posts on social media, Sutton said. Its website says it does this to prevent unhappy workers from stealing
                                company data or trade secrets. But there’s nothing in Teramind’s policy preventing companies from disciplining employees who
                                complain about a boss in an email to a co-worker — or from misusing the tool in any way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The company has to use it responsibly, Sutton said, adding that Teramind can be abused just like anything else, and his
                                company cannot implement safeguards without significantly hindering the software’s capability.

                                Spend too long scrolling on social media and your activity could be flagged. Teramind’s clients may set rules like
                                “no more than five minutes of Facebook at a time” or “no more than 60 minutes of Facebook a day,” Sutton said. If the
                                Teramind “agent” is turned on, the tool can collect social media activity, including what you type, even if you’re using
                                your personal accounts from a work computer or remote network. Some companies create exceptions for certain apps and sites
                                to avoid collecting data from employees’ personal social media accounts.

                                Hubstaff can take intermittent screenshots of your desktop to see what you’re up to. With Teramind, administrators can even

                                If you’re on a personal device, traffic routed through a company network is visible, so your company could have access,

                                In the case of Slack, whoever owns a Slack workspace — in this case, your employer — can apply to export messages from
                                private conversations and direct messages, per the company’s export policies. Slack says it will allow exports of private
                                conversations only if the employer has a “right under applicable laws.” But U.S. law allows companies to monitor employee
                                communication that’s part of the “normal course” of employment, which means, especially if you’ve signed an agreement outlining
                                the employer’s right to your communications, Slack is unlikely to deny the request.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Slack also reports your activity on the tool. Say you spent the day gazing at clouds but didn’t request time off to do so.
                                Slack might sell you out right here: [workspace].slack.com/stats. I searched my own name under the “members” tab and checked
                                how many days I’d been active on Slack out of the past 30. (It was 23 days, compared with 27 for one of my colleagues.
                                Now everyone knows I’m unlikely to check channels on weekends.)

                                Remote monitoring software can also record your video conferences. Teramind can capture audio and video from Zoom, Webex and
                                Microsoft Teams, for example.

                                    Some companies have gone further: Multinational call center company Teleperformance drew criticism after pressuring

                                Some employers even use this data to make personnel decisions — like letting people go — and, while that might not be a good
                                idea, they’re in their rights to do so, Gartner’s Kropp said. This summer, Russian company Xsolla said it used AI analytics
                                to justify the layoff of 150 “unengaged” employees,
                                <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2021/08/04/xsolla-fires-150-employees-using-big-data-and-ai-analysis-ceos-letter-causes-controversy">

                                One silver lining is that companies rarely look at this data at an individual level, Kropp said. The average manager,
                                InterGuard’s Harz said, isn’t a creep.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “At the end of the day, most managers don’t care if you’re buying your kid’s back-to-school lunchbox on Amazon,” she said.
                                “They’re doing the same thing.”

                                Monitoring tools also serve essential functions for companies. Occasionally, employees make cybersecurity mistakes or steal
                                sensitive data, and automated systems help stop that. Employee data makes for more “personalized” experiences on workplace
                                software the same way personal data helps websites serve more tailored offers, ads and features, Kropp said. And employees
                                who feel like they’re spending too much time on busywork can use InterGuard’s time-tracking tools to gather hard evidence,
                                Harz said.

                                If data collection also helps companies track productivity and encourages employees to stay focused, what’s the harm?

                                Surveillance makes employees lose trust and motivation, says Allen Holub, a software consultant who helps teams work
                                together more effectively. If you think your employees are going to steal from you, that’s a hiring problem, he said.
                                And if you worry they’re not going to do their jobs, then you’ve failed to create a system that incentivizes them — maybe
                                because they’re not paid a fair wage or their contributions at work don’t feel meaningful.  
                            </p>

                                According to IDX’s Kelly, this all hinges on how employers treat monitoring software: Are they being transparent, sharing
                                which metrics they’re collecting and why, and treating employees well?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The more important question, though, is whether employees have any power in this back-and-forth, said Roane, the Privacy
                                Rights Clearinghouse counsel. The line between “monitoring” and “surveillance” depends on whether individual employees can
                                opt out of data collection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “You can say no to the job,” Roane said. “But you probably can’t say no to that collection.”
