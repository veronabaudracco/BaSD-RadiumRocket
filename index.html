            <p>By Diana Leonard</p>
            <p>Today at 12:42 p.m. EDT</p>
            <p>The weather system that brought <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/09/16/rain-california-pacific-northwest-fall/">
            soaking rain</a> and fire relief to the Pacific Northwest and Northern California this weekend also kicked up winds that spread fire
            in Sequoia National Forest and Sequoia National Park, where giant sequoias and communities are threatened. As the cool and wet weather
            leaves the region, a quick turnaround to dry “offshore” winds is increasing fire danger in California again.</p>
            <p>Over the weekend, nearly a month’s worth of rain fell in parts of Washington and daily rainfall records were set in Oregon,
            with totals ranging between 1 and 5 inches from the coast to the western slopes of the Cascades.</p>
            <p>In the northwest corner of California, several stations exceeded two inches. In the high elevations of the Cascades and Northern
            California, <a href= "https://twitter.com/WeatherJefe/status/1439978322985848834">substantial</a> snow 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/WeatherJefe/status/1439601099690811395">fell</a> for this first time since
            the spring. Mount Shasta, which lost much of its snow cover this summer, <a href="https://twitter.com/US_Stormwatch/status/1439725850782420994">
            received a fresh coating</a>.</p>
            <p>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/09/15/mount-shasta-snow-summer-2021/">Mount Shasta became nearly snowless,
            a rare event that helped melt the mountain’s glaciers</a>]</p>
            <p>The precipitation has moderated activity for several fires in Northern California, including the Dixie Fire, which is now at 90
            percent containment.</p>
            <p>But the weather quickly shifted Sunday night with the arrival of gusty offshore winds that will usher in much drier air and higher
            temperatures this week. The winds present a fire risk for locations that saw little precipitation over the weekend, mainly in the 
            Sacramento Valley and surrounding ridges in the San Francisco Bay area and Sierra foothills. Some areas that did receive rain may also
            rapidly dry out.</p>

            California wildfires burn into groves of giant sequoia trees</a>
            <p>Red-flag warnings are in effect through 8 p.m. Monday for much of interior Northern California and through Tuesday morning farther east
            into the Sierra, including portions of the Caldor Fire. Gusts exceeding 50 mph were recorded on the ridge tops in the Bay Area overnight.</p>
            <p>The Los Angeles area will also see elevated fire risk due to hot and dry conditions combined with weak winds.</p>

                <h2>Fires in and near Sequoia groves</h2>
                <p>This weekend’s storm system brought strong winds but no rain to blazes burning in the vicinity of giant sequoia groves in the
                southern Sierra Nevada. The KNP Complex and the Windy Fire, each more than 23,000 acres, have grown considerably since Friday.</p>
                <p>However, firefighters’ efforts to protect the famed Giant Forest and General Sherman Tree in Sequoia National Park are progressing
                well, and there was minimal growth into that area Sunday.</p>
                <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/4-famous-giant-trees-unharmed-by-sequoia-national-park-fire/2021/09/20/7b238a8a-1a26-11ec-bea8-308ea134594f_story.html">
                4 famous giant trees unharmed by Sequoia National Park fire</a>
                <p>“The fortunate thing is the Park Service has done a lot of prescribed burning in there since the 1960s, and so it’s making their
                job a lot easier,” Jon Wallace, operations section chief on the KNP Complex, said in an update Sunday morning. “As that fire came out
                of the brush and timber … and up into that Giant Forest, the flame lengths really dropped down to 2 or 3 feet off the ground.”</p>
                <p>Farther south, the Windy Fire has burned into sequoia groves within the Giant Sequoia National Monument, including a portion the
                “Trail of 100 Giants” within the Long Meadow Grove. The popular hiking loop features over 100 towering trees that are up to 1,500
                years old.</p>
                <p>Giant sequoias, the world’s largest trees, grow in a narrow range of the Sierra’s western slopes. While the species thrives with
                low-to-moderate-intensity fire, extreme blazes can kill trees and permanently damage forests. This type of “high severity” fire has
                <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2020GL089858">increased</a> in Western forests in recent decades,
                fueled by climate change and poor forest health due to fire suppression and other factors.</p>
                <p>“The fire behavior within the Long Meadow Grove has been light to moderate,” Seth Mitchell, operations section chief, said in an
                interview Sunday. “It’s very favorable fire activity and the trees stand a good chance of surviving.”</p>

                <p>However, other groves had been directly affected by the Windy Fire, including the Peyrone Grove, which was fully within the 
                fire’s perimeter. An initial assessment of any damage to the trees could take days to complete, according to an 
                <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/7841/">InciWeb update</a>.</p>
                <p>Most of interior California experienced its hottest summer on record in 2021. The current water year, which ends on Sept. 30,
                is the driest on record for the southern Sierra, according to a six-station precipitation index that includes the Giant Forest in
                Sequoia National Park. An average of just 9.9 inches of rain has fallen this year, which is less than the previous driest year,
                at 10.9 inches in 1976-1977. Average annual rainfall for the area is 28.8 inches.</p>
